# 👩‍💻 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) section! 👩‍💻 This repository contains examples and exercises that illustrate key concepts in OOP.

## 📂 Key Concepts
In OOP, programming is organized around objects and classes, providing a modular, reusable, and maintainable approach to coding. The main concepts include:

### 🧩 Classes and Objects:

Class: A blueprint for creating objects. Defines attributes and methods.<br>
Object: An instance of a class, representing a real-world entity.

### 🏷️ Encapsulation:

Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class.<br>
Restricting access to certain details and only exposing necessary parts of an object.

### 🔄 Inheritance:

A mechanism where a new class (subclass/derived class) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass/base class).<br>
Promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchy.

### 🔄 Polymorphism:

Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.<br>
Enables methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.

### 🔧 Abstraction:

Hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features of an object.<br>
Simplifies interaction with complex systems.

### 🔁 Method Overriding:

A feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.<br>
Enhances the flexibility and reusability of the code.

### 🔍 Pointers:

Variables that store memory addresses of other variables.<br>
Used to refer to objects and can be essential for dynamic memory management.
